# ScoreProject

### Instructions to test the code 
You should edit the "input.txt" file located within the project folder. Here, you can input various test cases following the rules outlined in the PDF.

In the first line, you should input the number of rounds. In the following lines, you can start by entering the scores. First, you add the score of the first player, then insert a space, and finally, include the score of the second player. Following this same pattern, you continue to input the scores for the rounds specified in line 1.

Here are some usage examples:

To run the code you have to apply next command: python score.py input_file_name.txt //in this case the name of the file is "input" but that could be changed.
